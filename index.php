        The purpose of this website is to provide employers with an efficient and easy to use tool that evaluates the performance of their employers.<br>
        Do you want to keep track of the performance of your employees over the time or just let them know how they are doing?<br>
        Then the "Employee Performance Evaluation" system is what you are looking for!
    </p>
    <h2 id="look">How does it look like?</h2>
    <p>
        Employees will find their evaluated performance once they are logged in. <br>
        They will also have the possibility to compare their current evaluations with older ones by just scrolling down their page.<br> 
        In case the employee wishes, he can sort his/her evaluations by year<br>
        Doing so employees will always have the chance to compare different results from different times and eventually work on improving themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Employers can either analyze their employees previous performances and either add new ones or remove/edit old ones.<br>
        The new performance will be added on top of the older ones, while the others will be visibile by just scrolling down the page.<br>
        In case the employer wishes, he/she can sort his/her employees' evaluations by either year, name, or both.<br>
        This system will help employers to monitor and update their employees performances with relative ease and ina short period of time.
