        The purpose of this website is to provide employers with an efficient and easy to use tool that evaluates the performance of their employers.<br>
        Do you want to keep track of the performance of your employees over the time or just let them know how they are doing?<br>
        Then the "Employee Performance Evaluation" system is what you are looking for!
    </p>
    <h2>How does it look like?</h2>
    <p>
        Employees will find their evaluated performance once they are logged in. <br>
        They will also have the possibility to compare their current evaluations with older ones by just scrolling down their page.<br>
        Doing so employees will always have the chance to compare different results from different times and eventually work on improving themselves.

        Employers can either analyze their employees previous performances or add new ones.<br>
        The new performance will be added on top of the older ones, while the others will be visibile by just scrolling down the page.<br>
        This system will help employers to monitor and update their employees performances with relative ease and ina short period of time.
