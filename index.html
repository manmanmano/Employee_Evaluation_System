    <h1>Employee perfomance evaluation</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to JAM's most precious invention: the "Employee performance evaluation" system.<br>
    </p>
    <div id= "floating-login" style="float: right; margin-right: 30px; border-style: solid; padding: 10px;">

    <h2>How does it look like?</h2>
    <p>
        Employees will find their evaluated performance once they are logged in. <br>
        They will also have the possibility to compare their current evaluations with older ones by just scrolling down their page.<br>
        Doing so employees will always have the chance to compare different results from different times and eventually work on improving themselves.

    <p>
        Employers can either analyze their employees previous performances or add new ones.<br>
        The new performance will be added on top of the older ones, while the others will be visibile by just scrolling down the page.<br>
        This system will help employers to monitor and update their employees performances with relative ease and ina short period of time.
